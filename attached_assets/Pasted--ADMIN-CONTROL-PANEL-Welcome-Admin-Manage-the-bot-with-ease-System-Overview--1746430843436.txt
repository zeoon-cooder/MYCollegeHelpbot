Implementation Tips
Platform-Specific Features:
Telegram: Use InlineKeyboardMarkup for buttons and BotFather to set commands like /start, /menu, /stats.
Discord: Use Discord’s Button components and slash commands for a similar experience.
Error Handling: If an admin inputs invalid data (e.g., wrong Telegram ID), respond with a clear error message and a [Try Again] button.
Security: Restrict access to the admin panel using a whitelist of admin IDs.
Visuals: Use emojis consistently (e.g., 📳 for verification, 📚 for resources) to make the UI more engaging.
